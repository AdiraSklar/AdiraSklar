Hi! My name is Adira Sklar!
I am a passionate problem solver, who embraces creativity both in the realm of user interface design 
and when crafting innovative backend logic. 
I am an extremely hard worker and a lifelong, eager learner. 
Collaborating and working with others is something I do thoughtfully, 
and I thrive in the iterative process of transforming an idea into a product.
